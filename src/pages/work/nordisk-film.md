  Spaces on Wheels is a playful research project that invites people to envision
  the profound paradigm shift the development of self-driving cars could have on
  our everyday lives.
story: >-
  We are on the verge of what could be the most significant period of change in
  the automobile industry. Technologies like electrification, connected and
  automated driving are making notable progress. One day, in the not so distant
  future; fully autonomous vehicles could be a common occurrence on our everyday
  streets. This would not only redefine how people and goods move around our
  cities, but also redefine the very fabric of our daily lives. With this in
  mind, we have been working with IKEA‘s future living lab, SPACE10 to bring
  their exploration of urban mobility to life. 


  Spaces on Wheels explores how car interiors will change once automotive
  vehicles become commonplace. It is comprised of seven concepts — office, cafe,
  healthcare, farm, play, hotel, and shop — each of which addresses a specific
  use. To allow people to envision a future ecosystem of flexible, purpose-built
  spaces that are available on demand and designed to accommodate diverse needs
  and lifestyles, you can order and explore each of the 7 Spaces on Wheels
  directly from your phone via augmented reality.
