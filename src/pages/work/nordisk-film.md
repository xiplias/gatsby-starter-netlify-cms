  experience for their amazing cinemas across Denmark and Norway.
story: >-
  Over the past 100 years, Nordisk Film has been synonymous with great movie
  experiences and long lasting cinema moments for the people of Scandinavia. 

  For the evergrowing range of events and movies, Nordisk Film were in need of a
  new platform to connect with an audience that is increasingly mobile-first.
  Alongside Nordisk Film, we have delivered a best-in-class mobile booking
  experience, that appeals to a broad age group while maintaining the respect 

  for the core of Nordisk Film; the movies. 


  The Nordisk Film app has plenty to offer cinema-goers; find all the latest new
  and upcoming movies, watch trailers, read reviews and browse movie showtimes
  directly from the app. Along with a superiour booking experience, we have been
  sweating the details to design and build a state-of-the-art payment flow to
  deliver the first truly native booking experience in Scandinavia. With the new
  Nordisk Film app it is faster and more convenient to share the payment with
  friends, get reservation reminders and receive tickets directly on your
  device.
